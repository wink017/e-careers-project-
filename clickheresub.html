    <p>Studys have shown that gaming has also been associated with sleep deprivation
        insomnia and circadian rhythm disorder, depression, aggression and anxiety. with
        all these listed alot of people do not pay attention to the long term effect of gaming
        they rather focus on the short term benefit which builds up these bad side and making it difficult to stop on a
        long run.
        in as much as one can benefit from gaming i believe in life they should always be a balance in everything you
        do.
